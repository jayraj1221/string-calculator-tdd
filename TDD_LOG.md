- Installed Jest (`npm install --save-dev jest`)
- Created the following folder structure:
  - `src/` â†’ contains main logic (`calculator.js`)
  - `test/` â†’ contains unit tests (`calculator.test.js`)
  - `screenshots/` â†’ for visuals like test results and commit history
- Created boilerplate files:
  - `.gitignore` â†’ to ignore `node_modules/` and `screenshots/`
  - `README.md` â†’ project overview and instructions
  - `TDD_LOG.md` â†’ this file for tracking TDD evolution
- Added `.gitkeep` inside `screenshots/` to include empty folder in Git
